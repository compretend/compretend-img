### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for compretend. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). Fill out [the required template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* **Check if you can reproduce the problem.
* **Determine which repository the problem should be reported in**.
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/search?q=+is%3Aissue+user%3Acompretend)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined [which repository](https://github.com/compretend) your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information by filling in [the template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. When listing steps, **include what you did, and explain how you did it**.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. If you use the keyboard while following the steps, **record the GIF with the [Keybinding Resolver](https://github.com/atom/keybinding-resolver) shown**. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.

### Your First Code Contribution

If you have never created a pull request before, [check out this tutorial](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)
on how to send one.

1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone your fork,
   and configure the remotes:

   ```bash
   # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>
   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
   cd <repo-name>
   # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/hoodiehq/<repo-name>
   ```

2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git pull upstream master
   ```

3. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to
   contain your feature, change, or fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

4. Make sure to update, or add to the tests when appropriate. Patches and
   features will not be accepted without tests. Run `npm test` to check that
   all tests pass after you've made changes. Look for a `Testing` section in
   the projectâ€™s README for more information.

5. If you added or changed a feature, make sure to document it accordingly in
   the `README.md` file.

6. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```

8. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
    with a clear title and description.

### For compretend contributors

1. Clone the repo and create a branch

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/compretend/<repo-name>
   cd <repo-name>
   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

2. Make sure to update, or add to the tests when appropriate. Patches and
   features will not be accepted without tests. Run `npm test` to check that
   all tests pass after you've made changes. Look for a `Testing` section in
   the projectâ€™s README for more information.

3. If you added or changed a feature, make sure to document it accordingly in
   the `README.md` file.

4. Push your topic branch up to our repo

   ```bash
   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```

5. Open a Pull Request using your branch with a clear title and description.

Optionally, you can help us with these things. But donâ€™t worry if they are too
complicated, we can help you out and teach you as we go :)

1. Update your branch to the latest changes in the upstream master branch. You
   can do that locally with

   ```bash
   git pull --rebase upstream master
   ```

   Afterwards force push your changes to your remote feature branch.

2. Once a pull request is good to go, you can tidy up your commit messages using
   Git's [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase).
   Please follow our commit message conventions shown below, as they are used by
   [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to
   automatically determine the new version and release to npm.

**IMPORTANT**: By submitting a patch, you agree to license your work under the
same license as that used by the project.

### Pull requests

Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic
help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated
commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g.
implementing features, refactoring code), otherwise you risk spending a lot of
time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge
into the project.
